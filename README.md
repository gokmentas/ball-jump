# Ball Jump

Ball Jump is an entry-level Hyper Casual game developed in Unity3D. The game challenges players to guide a ball down a twistable tower filled with empty spaces. Players must use their mouse to rotate the tower, allowing the ball to pass through gaps while avoiding colliding with red platforms. Be careful, as colliding with red platforms results in a game over!
